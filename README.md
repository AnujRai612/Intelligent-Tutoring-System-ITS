# Intelligent-Tutoring-System-ITS

Welcome to the Intelligent Tutoring System project ! This intelligent tutoring system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to create an adaptive learning experience. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) and RAG, it provides real-time feedback and personalized learning pathways for learners.

# 🚀 About the Project
In this project, we have build a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. Using powerful tools like LangChain, ChromaDB, and HuggingFace Transformers, we have created a system capable of retrieving relevant document chunks and generating context-aware answers.

This project demonstrates the power of RAG systems in creating AI-driven educational tools, specifically tailored to provide personalized feedback to learners.

# 🎯 What We have Learn:
Preprocessing and Vectorizing Documents with LangChain
Efficient Similarity Searches using ChromaDB
Integrating Embeddings and Retrieval into the workflow
Generating Accurate, Context-Aware Answers using LLMs
Building an Interactive UI with Streamlit

# 💡 Technologies Used:
LangChain – For document preprocessing and chaining models
ChromaDB – To perform efficient similarity searches and store embeddings
HuggingFace Transformers – To leverage state-of-the-art LLMs for generating context-aware responses
Streamlit – To build an interactive user interface for the tutoring system


# 💻 Installation
Prerequisites:
Python 3.7+
Install required libraries via requirements.txt:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Running the System:
Clone the repository:
git clone <repo-url>
cd GenAI_LLM_RAG_Tutoring_System
Run the Streamlit app:
streamlit run app.py

🔥 Why RAG?
RAG systems enhance the capabilities of LLMs by incorporating external knowledge through retrieval. This enables more accurate, context-aware responses, which is particularly useful for personalized tutoring systems like this one. By combining retrieval and generation, you can adapt learning experiences to each learner’s needs in real-time.

Happy Learning! 🚀
